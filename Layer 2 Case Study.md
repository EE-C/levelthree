**Brief Project Summary**


Level Three will be a series of case studies for use in my classroom originally, but released on an open source licence [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/) on GitHub for general use. The broad project aims to cover all the major areas of the Ethereum ecosystem: DAOs, DeFi, NFTs and Layer 2. This particular case study will be an online document of approximately 3,000 words focusing on Arbitrum and zkSync (chosen as two highly popular L2s that are representative of their differing approaches to scaling). The case study will be used in my module [MIS41220: The Ethereum Ecosystem](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=MODULE&MODULE=MIS41220). This is the first module, launched in 2021, focused exclusively on Ethereum globally.

**Grant Scope**

Level Three: Web3 Educational Case Studies is a project designed to create a series of case studies for use in Ethereum-focused modules at University level. The overarching intention is to cover all the main areas of the industry (Ethereum, DAOs, DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2, etc.). This particular grant is seeking funding for a 3,000 word case study of two popular layer 2 solutions: Arbitrum and zkSync.

The Layer 2 scaling case study document will include the following sections:

History of Ethereum and Scaling.
Overview of Arbitrum and Optimistic Rollups.
Overview of zkSync and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
The Challenge.

The case study starts in late 2017 when the early NFT project Cryptokitties clogs the Ethereum blockchain and brings into fresh light the necessity of scaling Ethereum. It contextualises the question of scaling in light of the blockchain trilemma and what the different trade-offs in terms of various proposed solutions are, e.g. sharding, sidechains, rollups. It then turns its attention specifically to Optimistic Rollups and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The differences between both will be elucidated via the practical examples of Arbitrum and zkSync. In the classroom discussion, students will be placed in the position of either a company/organisation or a DAO (students choose their preferred model) that is wondering where to deploy their dApp first. The exercise is designed to (a) put them into the mindset of a real Ethereum company, organisation, or DAO and (b) to think carefully about the two main scaling options, with their choice revealing which they think has more promise. Per my general teaching approach, the idea is to reveal Ethereum to students not as an abstract technology, but a living one they can get involve with right away.

**Project Goals and Success Factors**

In many projects this might be a complicated section, but in this project it is simply 3,000 word document released on an open source licence on GitHub for general use at University level. Immediate impact may be hard to measure, but I aim to document the experience in media where possible (I am a CoinDesk Columnist) and will discuss the successes and failures that may emerge there. The best outcome, naturally, is adoption by other lecturers.


**What Problem are you trying to solve?**

I have been teaching cryptocurrencies, blockchain and Web3 since 2016 and Ethereum specifically since 2021 and it has become more and more apparent with time that the field can be overwhelming to new students. The topic is multidisciplinary and makes heavy cognitive demands on even the most engaged students. In order to cover large areas in relatively condensed time periods, such as a lecture, I have turned more and more to exercises that place the student into the world of Ethereum. I am aiming to solve the disconnect between Ethereum as an abstract technology used only by highly sophisticated actors and to pull students into its orbit, such that they can imagine themselves as participants. The best method for this is almost certainly the case study, which is essentially imaginative learning, but applied to a business context. 


**How does it benefit the greater Ethereum ecosystem?**

It promotes the teaching of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and Web3 through the lens of Ethereum. It promotes the creation and sharing of open source educational materials that could be used on the Ethereum.org website. It helps promotes the migration from L1 to L2 thinking that is increasingly central to Ethereum’s Endgame. It trains emerging Ethereum enthusiasts. It is also, I would argue, a public good in the simple sense that education is always a positive. 


**Budget Breakdown and Roadmap**

I am seeking $10,000.

$5,000 – Research assistant.
I will hire a Research Assistant from my MSc class to perform research. Their task will be to identify relevant materials and pre-existing research. 

$2,500 – Conference fees. 
I will attend a small number of events in order to promote the case studies, such as ETHBarcelona or EthCC, that are closest to me in Europe.

$1,500 – Editor. 
I will hire an editor at the end of the project to ensure there are no typos or errors.

$1,000 – NFT creation, POAP, bridge fees, gas fees.
I will create NFTs or a POAP for students on completion of the case study. 

I intend to deliver the case study by July 2023.
