Level Three: Web3 Educational Case Studies is a repository of open source case studies to be used in University modules and courses. It begins with a case study of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol [Aave](https://aave.com//). 



About the Principal Investigator (PI).

My name is Dr. Paul Dylan-Ennis (better known in Web3 as polarpunklabs). I am a Lecturer/Assistant Professor in Management Information Systems (MIS) in the College of Business, University College Dublin. My research interests are Bitcoin, Ethereum, DAOs, DeFi and NFTs. I argue Crypto/Web3 is best understood as a form of cultural expression with associated micro-economies. To this end, I focus on the creativity of cryptocultures. I am a [CoinDesk columnist](https://www.coindesk.com/author/PaulEnnis/), Ethereum.org contributor and a Founding Member of the Blockchain Association of Ireland. I created one of the earliest modules on cryptocurrencies in 2016 and the first module on Ethereum internationally in 2021.
